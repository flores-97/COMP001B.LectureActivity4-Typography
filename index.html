        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Lego Star Wars is based on the Star Wars saga and franchise. The product line directly focuses on the Star Wars characters 
                from the films and TV Series, with the exception of a few special characters. It was first announced in February 1999 at 
                the North American International Toy Fair,[6] serving as a tie-in to Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, that would 
                be released in May.</p>

        <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>The Lego Star Wars designers have revealed how they have "changed strategy" to get popular minifigures into cheaper and 
                    more accessible sets. Lego Star Wars Creative Lead Jens Kronvold Frederiksen explained, "We have changed our strategy a 
                    little bit over the years," and continued, "Where in the past, we often kept some of them – the most important especially 
                    – for the higher prices, we are now thinking young kids, maybe newcomers to Star Wars, want to get into it</p>

        <h2>Minifigures</h2>        
                <p>Some minifigures repeatedly appear across multiple Lego sets, while others can be very rare, vastly increasing their resale 
                    value. Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader are the themes most prominent minifigures while battle droids are, by quantity, one 
                    of the most often appearing minifigures in all of Lego. The first Lego Star Wars minifigures to ever be released were Luke 
                    Skywalker and Ben Kenobi from #7110 "Landspeeder".[13] Tan colored OOM battle droids are the first Lego Star Wars minifigure 
                    by production code (sw0001a) and have only four different unique designs, all of which are only different oriented arms and 
                    an additional backplate.[14][15] Lego switched the skin tone from yellow to a more natural skin tone between 2003 and 2004, 
                    and by 2005 the yellow skin tone was retired in the Lego Star Wars line. In 2019, the number of Lego Star Wars minifigures has 
                    surpassed 1000, with the Battlefront II protagonist Iden Versio bearing code sw1000</p>
